Hey there,

first of all: thank you for taking your time to bring this project forward! I really appreciate any help and ideas.

Working in a group requires some ground rules.
To keep the code base in a good shape, we use linters and formatters.

If you create a PR, please try to fix any linting errors and format the code.
You can find the required modules in [requirements-dev.txt](https://github.com/provinzio/CoinTaxman/blob/main/requirements-dev.txt) and the needed commands to run the linters and formatters in [Makefile](https://github.com/provinzio/CoinTaxman/blob/main/Makefile).
If you use `make`, awesome. It'll be very easy to check and adjust your code (`make format`, `make lint`). If not, feel free to copy/paste the commands from the file.
